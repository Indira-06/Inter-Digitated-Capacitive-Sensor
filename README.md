# Inter-Digitated Capacitive Sensor

This project focuses on the modeling and simulation of an **Inter-Digitated Capacitive (IDC) Sensor**, developed as part of an academic requirement. The sensor was designed and analyzed using Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT), evaluating its sensitivity, permittivity response, and capacitance change due to geometry variations.

## Project Objectives

- Understand the working principle of IDC sensors.
- Simulate electric field distribution and capacitance using AEDT.
- Analyze the effect of inter-digit dimensions on sensor performance.

## Project Structure

- `Main/` - Contains all Ansys `.aedt` files related to the sensor modeling.
- `Report.pdf` - Final project report with design explanation and results.
- `Project Guidelines.pdf` - Evaluation instructions.

## Tools Used

- **Ansys Electronics Desktop**
- **Ansys Maxwell 2D/3D**
